project description--

FULL DEVELOPMENT LOGIC & FLOW — AI-Enhanced CLM PLATFORM
🧱 1. System Architecture
🔸 Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui)
Responsive UI using Tailwind

Clean UX with shadcn/ui (Cards, Dialogs, Tables, Menus, Sheet, Tooltip, Accordion)

Lottie animations or Framer Motion for UI polish

🔸 Backend (NestJS + PostgreSQL)
REST/GraphQL API for all contract operations

Role-based access control with guards

Async queues for AI processing (BullMQ or Event-Driven with Redis)

🔸 Firebase (Authentication & File Storage)
Firebase Auth → ID token → Backend Verification

Firebase Storage → Store PDF/DOCX → get public/signed URLs

🔸 Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
Key tables:

users: name, email, role, org_id

contracts: id, title, status, created_by, uploaded_file_url, expiry_date

contract_versions: id, contract_id, file_url, created_at

clauses: id, contract_id, type, text, risk_score

comments: clause_id/version_id, user_id, text, position

contract_summary: contract_id, summary_text, created_at

reminders: contract_id, user_id, send_on

activity_logs: action, actor, contract_id, timestamp

📄 2. Contract Upload and Versioning
Logic:
Frontend file uploader → upload to Firebase Storage

On success, send file metadata to backend:

Original filename, Firebase URL, uploader ID

Parse and extract plain text (using pdf-parse, docx or mammoth)

Save contract + version entry

Future uploads to same contract become new versions

🗂 3. Contract Viewing Interface
Logic:
List all contracts with filtering (date, status, party, etc.)

Display status chips (Draft, Review, Signed, Expired)

Open any contract → see:

File viewer

Metadata

AI summary (if available)

Clauses, comments, risks, and timeline

🔐 4. Authentication & Access Control
Logic:
Firebase handles email/password or OAuth login

Firebase ID token → backend verifies + creates/updates user

User roles: Admin, Legal, Viewer

Backend guards check role before allowing access to routes

🧠 5. AI/NLP Feature Suite
📌 a. Clause Extraction
On upload, extract key clauses using:

Regex templates

OpenAI function calling (extract_clause(type): {...})

Save extracted clause text by type (Termination, Confidentiality, etc.)

📌 b. Risk Term Detection
Predefined rules (e.g., indemnity, auto-renewal)

Use LLM or zero-shot classification to rate clauses: Low / Medium / High Risk

Visual highlights in UI

📌 c. Version Comparison
Use text diff lib (e.g., diff-match-patch)

Display inline diff between two versions

Optional: LLM to summarize what's changed

📌 d. Contract Q&A Assistant
Embed contract chunks with LangChain or pgvector

User question → similarity search → top 3-5 chunks

LLM responds based on context

📌 e. Auto Summary (5-Bullet)
On upload or button click, send full text to LLM

Summarize into 5 key points

Save to contract_summary table

📌 f. Smart Metadata Autofill
LLM extracts:

Effective date

Parties

Payment terms

Fill backend fields with AI-generated values for editing/confirmation

📌 g. Clause Recommendation
From smart clause library

Suggest clauses based on context using retrieval or classification

Admin can approve/update master clause templates

📌 h. Risk Score for Entire Contract
Average clause risk

Use weighted scoring model

Show in UI as badge or gauge meter

📌 i. AI-Based Similarity Search
Given a clause, find similar clauses across contracts

Useful for compliance/legal review

📌 j. LLM Explanation for Clauses
Button beside clause: “Explain this”

LLM rewrites in plain English for quick understanding

📌 k. AI Negotiation Assistant (Optional Bonus)
Suggest redlines/changes

“Make this less risky” → modifies clause via LLM

“Suggest better termination clause”

📌 l. OCR for Scanned PDFs
Use Tesseract or AWS Textract

Convert image-based contracts to searchable text before AI processing

📬 6. Notifications & Reminders
Logic:
User sets expiry/reminder dates

NestJS Cron (or Firebase Cloud Function) checks daily

Sends email reminders via SendGrid or Mailgun

🧾 7. Audit Trail & Activity Logs
Logic:
Every contract action (upload, edit, comment, AI change) logged

Store who, what, when in activity_logs

Display timeline on contract detail page

🧑‍💼 8. Redlining & Commenting Interface
Logic:
Allow users to comment on clause or text section

Store comment linked to version or clause

Real-time updates via WebSocket or polling

Accept/Reject suggestions (like Google Docs)

📊 9. Analytics Dashboard
Logic:
Total contracts, pending, signed, expired

Breakdown by counterparty, type, risk

Show top risky contracts, upcoming renewals

Use Recharts or Chart.js in shadcn panels

✍️ 10. UI/UX Design (shadcn/ui)
Key Principles:
Use shadcn Sheet for side drawers (edit/view)

Tabs for switching between Summary, AI, Clauses, Comments

Dialog for pop-ups (Add Reminder, Upload Version)

Table with pagination and filters for contract list

Tooltip for AI explanations

Accordion for clause sections

Toast and Alert for user feedback

Card and Badge components for statuses and summaries


Testing: Playwright (UI), Jest (backend)
